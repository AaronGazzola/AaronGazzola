Hi, I'm Aaron (34M; BSc. Hons.), I specialize in Quality Assurance for web apps generated with Lovable. I provide in-depth analysis, refactoring, and automated testing for every aspect of your web app. My 5 years of experience in full-stack design and development provide me with critical insight and comprehensive knowledge of every aspect of your project. You will receive in-depth progress reports and test results at each stage of development - lifting the veil on the inner workings of your creation.
